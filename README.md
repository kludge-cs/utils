# @kludge-cs/changeset-format

The changesets formatter for KCS monorepositories, such as [@kludge-cs/utils].
This is a fork of [@changesets/changelog-github] and
[@changesets/get-github-info], except with better code quality (this will
eventually be PRed into the changesets repository, at which point this will be
kept solely in case we need additional features or alternative formatting,
assuming Atlassian developers will approve the merge).
