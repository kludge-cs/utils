# Code of Conduct

## Preface, and Our Philosophy

KCS projects follow our CEO's design and scientific philosophy, adapted and
deriving from the initial UNIX philosophy. As such, this statement is one we
hold to our core: **Irrational prejudice and abstract discrimination has no
place in science.** We are not interested in the abstract personal attributes of
our contributors, merely their skill and reasoning as scientists, and the
quality of their work.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of personal
background. The only thing that sets us apart as scientists is our ability to
problem-solve, rise to the challenges we are faced with, and work with the
information at hand.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating respect and civility towards other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting accountability for our actions and acknowledging our mistakes
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem harmful within the boundaries of reason.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not
follow this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate or upon request.

Note that it is important to us that we are not perpetuators of censorship;
rather, we seek only to establish an environment that reasonably enables
everyone to work comfortably. We vow to not overstep boundaries or punish people
based solely on our personal beliefs, and instead to act with rational and
appropriate response.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

An individual's personal life is not bound to their career image, and we impose
no requirements for their conduct out of our field. However, if one's personal
image directly ties to their professional image, id est if their personal
platforms are under the same alias they use to work with us, we reserve the
right to impose necessary sanctions or restrictions in order to protect our
image as a development community from being tarnished by their personal actions.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. All complaints
will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
